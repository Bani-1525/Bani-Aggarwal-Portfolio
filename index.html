            <h4> PYTHON CLI PROJECT | File Organizer</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a Python script using os and shutil to automatically organize files into folders by type (e.g.,PDF, Images, Docs).</li>
                <li> Implemented OOP principles and exception handling to ensure reusability and robustness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> FUSION 360 PROJECT | ROBOTIC GRIPPER</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Crafted detailed simulations within Fusion 360 that informed critical adjustments to the robot’s gripping mechanism and conducted simulations and stress analysis within Fusion 360 to guarantee durability and functionality across various load conditions.</li>
                <li>Integrated specialized components to optimize gripper versatility, enabling seamless adaptation for handling distinct shapes, sizes, and materials without compromising performance or efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> STUDENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Context: Need for a basic database to store and manage student academic records</li>
                <li>Action: Designed a relational schema and implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries with HTML form integration.</li>
                <li>Enabled efficient data storage and retrieval for up to 500+ records in test runs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> TO-DO WEB APPLICATION</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Context: Increasing need for simple task management tools for daily productivity</li>
                <li>Action: Building a responsive to-do web app to add, delete, and track tasks using JavaScript for client-side logic.</li>
                <li>Improve task tracking efficiency for users by providing an easy-to-use web interface.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4> CollabBoard– Real-Time Collaboration Platform (MERN) [In Progress]</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenge: Teams juggle 3–4 separate tools (Docs, Trello, Slack, Drive), leading to fragmented workflows and time loss.</li>
                <li>Action: Designed a MERN-based platform integrating document editing, task management, and discussions in one place. Implemented real-time collaboration using Socket.io, created scalable REST APIs with Node.js/Express, and stored project data in MongoDB. Added third-party integrations like AI summarization and automated email notifications.</li>
                <li>Result: Built a unified workspace prototype that can support 50+ concurrent users with real-time sync, reducing tool-switching overhead by an estimated 40–50%</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT | INTERNSHALA</h4>
